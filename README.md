# Trivia Game

This is an android application that allows users to play a trivia game with friends using Java and Spring Boot!

Players can either host a game or join a game that another user is hosting.
As a host, you can create questions and decide when to start and move on to the next question.
As a player, you join a host's lobby and play the trivia game. The application will keep track of the players score.
